## üíª How to Run Source Code Locally

Follow the steps in this guide: [Debugging Google Chrome Extensions Locally](https://medium.com/@leochen6687/debugging-google-chrome-extensions-locally-a-quick-easy-guide-b9f55ed14cbd)

**Note**: A pretrained model on "Friends" dataset is provided in `extension/model/face_recognition.json`

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Train on Customized Face Dataset

### Step 1:

Put your dataset in folder `training-script/data/raw`

### Step 2:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leochen66/face-blindness-saver.git
cd face-blindness-saver/training-script
npm install
npm run pipline
```

The pipeline will run data-preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

### Step 3:

The model will be saved in `training-script/model/face-recognition`. Copy this model to folder `extension/model/face-recognition` and the extension will apply this model.
